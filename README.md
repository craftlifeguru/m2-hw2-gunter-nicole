This Bootstrap business is amazeballs
I wish I had this before now
My life just got a little bit less stressful
Thank you!
I did have some issues to work out
I used "col-md-4" to actually make my images line up 3 across
I struggled with that because I understood it as use that number for the amount of elements
I used W3Schools and Bootstrap tutorials to work things out
